                Welcome to AngouriMath.Terminal.

It is an interface to AngouriMath, open source symbolic algebra
library. The terminal uses F# Interactive inside, so that you can
run any command you could in normal F#. AngouriMath.FSharp is
being installed every start, so you are guaranteed to be on the
latest version of it. Type 'preRunCode' to see, what code
was pre-ran before you were able to type.
